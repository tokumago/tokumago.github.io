It was the first line of code in college that defined my career path. From that moment as a Mathematics student, I focused my efforts to apply my theorical knowledge in the world of software engineering. Along this path, I have learned to work as a team member and as a leader, always trying to implement good practices, documentation and clean code to all the projects Iâ€™ve worked on, the most important so far is a Mexican Sign Language web dictionary.
